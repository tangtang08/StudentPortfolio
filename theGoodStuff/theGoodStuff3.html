				<h3>About The Programmer </h3>

		<p>  This summer I'm enrolled in TK2 coding bootcamp. I will graduate as a Full Stack JAVA Developer. 
				I'm also finishing my Computer Science degree in Programming & analysis. Before pursing my degree in 
				Programming, I worked in Post Production editing for small productions, and as a Producer for Independent 
				productions. I also worked as an Assistant Editor & Post Coordinator for companies like ABC, NBC & MTV in 
				L.A as a freelance editor. I then formed a small company doing lead generation working with companies in 
				the states and overseas.

		<p><br> I spent my life being fascinated with the way computers function. After being the 'go to computer person ' 
		for  friends and family, 
		I finally decided to my passion to the next level, and starting to learn programming. I went to Broward College to 
		get my degree in Programming and Analysis. While I was attending I decided to accelerate my learning curve. I 
		attended TK2 coding Bootcamp, to become a Full Stack JAVA Developer. 

	<p>Because I always enjoying learning and finding solutions to challenges and problems, I fell in love with programming. 
	During this journey, I won 2 awards at 2 different Hackthons and had articles writing about my achievements. 
	I look forward to furthering my career as a Jr. Full Stack JAVA Programmer, with a forward-thinking company. 
	I would like to share my skills as a Jr. Programmer, who is open-minded and ready to grow even more. <br></p>
